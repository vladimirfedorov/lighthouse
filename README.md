# Lighthouse

This is a PlayDate game developed during [PlayJam 5](https://itch.io/jam/playjam-5).

## Day One

Following the theme "You Forgot Something", I decided to create a game about a lighthouse that saves ships from perilous sea monsters and the cliff it stands on; *but things are not what they look like*. Below is the very first game draft:

By the end of the day, I had developed most of the game mechanics (sea monsters excluded) and optimized the code, because the game run at about 17 FPS on the device.

And (quite alarmingly) that was it.
